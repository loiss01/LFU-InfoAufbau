To save the state of the current game, I would create a new class called „gameState“. I chose a class for better handing of different savestates.


The "gameState" class contains a variable of the type list. The list has 9 entries each entry is a string of these strings {"null", "green", "red"}. 
Further has the "gameState" class the necessary setter and getter methods. With those the saving and receiving of date is more easily. 

1-2-3 
4-5-6 
7-8-9 

Each entry of the list is representing of one field of the gameboard. For example top left is the first entry in the list,
the middle entry of the 2nd row is the 5th entry of the list,... 

To call the entry is would go something like this:
gameState.getField(4);
to save:
gameState.setField(2,”green”);
